# WebMSX

WebMSX, or simply WMSX, is a new MSX emulator designed for the Web.

Its goal is not to emulate every single machine combination and piece of hardware in existence. 
Instead, it will focus on delivering a simple and straight forward experience, with ease of deployment in webpages.

Still in development, the first beta release is available and should be already capable of emulating the majority of MSX1 software.
